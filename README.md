## About Logging
ASW$J integrates with <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J logging API</a> to provide insightful information during execution. It categories execution messages into three different logging level (trace, debug, and info) to meet the diversity needs of different stages of development. To know more about how to integrate SLF4J, please visit <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">http://www.slf4j.org/</a>.
